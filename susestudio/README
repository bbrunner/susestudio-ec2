README for SUSE Studio Amazon EC2 appliance
------------------------------------------------

This tarball contains the Amazon EC2 appliance created by SUSE Studio and the
create_ami.sh script. The script bundles and uploads the appliance to Amazon
S3. It also registers it with Amazon EC2 as an AMI (Amazon Machine Image).

The Amazon EC2 AMI and API tools must be installed for the script to work. These
can be found at:

  http://developer.amazonwebservices.com/connect/entry.jspa?externalID=368
  http://developer.amazonwebservices.com/connect/entry.jspa?externalID=351

Additional help on setting up these tools can be found here:
http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AmazonEC2/gsg/2006-06-26/setting-up-your-tools.html

In order to access Amazon Web Services (AWS), the script requires the following
environment variables to be defined:

  $AWS_USER_ID     - AWS user ID (eg. 123456789012)
  $AWS_ACCESS_KEY  - AWS access key ID (eg. ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRST)
  $AWS_SECRET_KEY  - AWS secret access key (eg. abcdefghijklmnoprqrtuvwxyzabcdv)
  $EC2_CERT        - Path to EC2 X.509 certification (eg. ~/cert-aws.pem)
  $EC2_PRIVATE_KEY - Path to EC2 private key (eg. ~/pk-ec2.pem)
