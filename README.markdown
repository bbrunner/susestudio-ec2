SUSE Studio EC2 scripts
===================

This repository contains the files bundled with the [Amazon
EC2](http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/) images built by [SUSE
Studio](http://susestudio.com).

The README files are included verbatim, while the scripts have the values
marked in {} substituted to the specific value during image creation in SUSE
Studio. These variables can be modified locally to fit your specific image.

The code in this repository ([jamestyj/susestudio-ec2](
https://github.com/jamestyj/susestudio-ec2)) will be merged into
[susestudio.com](http://susestudio.com) during its weekly deployments. Bug fix
and feature patches and pull requests are welcomed.
